// Pure decision logic for Claude plan rotation (PR2a).
//
// See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-claude-key-rotation-design.md for the
// full design. This module answers two narrow questions, kept pure (no fs/
// network) so the thresholds are unit-tested with fixtures, mirroring
// quota-gate.ts:
//
//   1. How much headroom does an INACTIVE plan probably have right now?
//      (estimateWindowFree) -- deterministic, not fuzzy: an inactive plan's
//      usage is FROZEN at its last observed percentage, because nothing
//      consumes its quota while it is not the active login. The only thing
//      that changes an inactive plan's estimate is a reset boundary passing,
//      which is a known, computable instant, not a guess.
//
//   2. Given the ACTIVE plan's pressure and the other plans' estimated
//      headroom, should the fleet rotate now, wait for the reset, or rotate
//      to a specific target? (decideRotationAction)
//
// FAIL OPEN, same rule as quota-gate.ts: a plan with no observation yet is
// assumed to have full headroom (100% free) rather than excluded, because
// "we don't know" must never be a reason to strand the fleet on a spent plan.
//
// This module does NOT decide whether MAIN_AGENT_ISOLATED_CONFIG is active,
// does not read store/claude-plans.json or store/usage-latest.json, and does
// not restart any session. Those are wiring (PR2c).

// implementációs kérdés") -- this PR ships only the pure classifier; wiring
// it into a live tmux-output watcher is a separate, riskier follow-up (it
// means parsing a running session's output, not just reading a JSON
// snapshot) and is intentionally NOT part of this PR. See the PR description.
//
// Deliberately conservative: false negatives (missing a real quota error) are
// safe -- the proactive path still catches it within one heartbeat cycle.
// False positives are not: this string match must not fire on a plain error
// message that happens to mention "limit" for an unrelated reason, so it
// requires one of a short list of high-specificity phrases rather than any
// single common word.
