// CFGDIR686 structural locks -- the sibling of the RESPAWNMODEL807 describe in
// main-model-resolution-parity.test.ts, on the OTHER axis.
//
// The main agent's isolated CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is the fix for the 2026-07-23/27
// 401 outages: without it the agent re-authenticates from whatever refreshes the
// shared ~/.claude, that credential expires, and the main bot goes silent until
// someone runs /login by hand.
//
// PR #686 put that decision on ONE of the two shell respawn paths. The other,
// stuck-modal-guard.sh, was written in PR #264 and never had it -- so a respawn
// from there dropped the agent back onto the shared root, silently, and at the
// worst possible moment (the session is already stuck, so the owner is already
// not getting answers and has no way to tell the two causes apart).
//
// The same shape had already happened on the model axis, which is why the model
// test locks all its paths at once. This file does it for the config-dir axis:
// the point is not that these two files are correct today, but that a THIRD
// respawner cannot be added without either carrying the decision or failing here.
