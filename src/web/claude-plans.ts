// Named Claude subscription registry.
//
// A "plan" is a named Claude login: a label plus the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR that
// carries its credentials/plugins/sessions, tagged with whether it is a
// personal or a company/team subscription and whether external Channels use
// is allowed on it. Agents reference a plan by its stable `id` (per-agent
// `claudePlan` field) instead of repeating a raw config-dir path, so many
// agents can share one login and the operator can re-point an agent from the
// dashboard with a single field.
//
// This module was the READ + VALIDATE half in PR1. PR2b (see
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-claude-key-rotation-design.md section 7)
// adds the WRITE half: writeClaudePlans() + the exported validatePlan(), used
// by the dashboard CRUD route so a malformed entry can never reach disk
// through a different gate than the one resolveClaudePlans() reads back
// through. It still does NOT wire the main agent (channels.sh), do drift
// detection, or perform any rotation -- those stay separate, gated follow-ups
// (PR2c / PR3). The launch integration for regular agents lives in
// agent-process.ts and is strictly additive: no plan set => existing
// behaviour.
//
// The store file (store/claude-plans.json) is operator-owned and edited via
// the dashboard; it is an array of raw plan objects. resolveClaudePlans() is
// kept pure (raw JSON string + homeDir in, validated array out) so it unit-
// tests without the fs, mirroring resolveClaudeConfigDir in agent-config.ts.

// isolated config dir when nothing was configured (agent-process.ts:
// ensureIsolatedChannelConfigDir -> agents/<name>/.claude-config). It is the
// WRONG question for a reader, because the launcher's second step is invisible
// to it: the agent is writing into the isolated dir while the reader looks in
// ~/.claude.
//
// MEASURED 2026-08-21 07:03: every sub-agent's contextTokens on the dashboard
// was byte-identical at 04:09 and at 07:00, across three hours in which one of
// them ran a 12 MB catalogue audit. The live transcripts (agents/<name>/
// .claude-config/projects/...) carried that morning's mtime and 3-7 MB; the
// files actually being read (~/.claude/projects/-home-...-agents-<name>/) had
// all stopped on 2026-08-18 15:44 at 0.2-0.5 MB.
//
// Why that is worse than a stale number on a screen: context-restart-gate-
// runner.ts treats a null contextTokens as a fail-closed BLOCK. Here nothing
// was null -- the old files still existed, so the gate got a confident,
// three-day-old value and could not tell that it was blind. The same number
// feeds the model suggestion (routes/agents.ts).
//
// This deliberately probes the filesystem rather than re-deriving the
// launcher's decision (fleet token present? channel agent? auth mode?):
// duplicating that logic is how the two paths drifted apart in the first
// place. The isolated dir EXISTS only because the launcher provisioned it, so
// its presence is the launcher's own answer, read back.
// `projectRootOverride` exists for the tests: the isolated dir is found by
// probing the filesystem, so the probe root has to be redirectable to a
// fixture. Production callers pass nothing.
