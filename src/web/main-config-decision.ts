// The main agent's config-dir decision, made ONCE and reported on the way past.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR (kanban card `guard-respawn-vak`). scripts/channels.sh
// shouts when the main agent comes up on the shared ~/.claude. Every other way
// the main session starts -- the nightly 03:00 respawn, the stage-3 recovery
// resume, the hard restart -- goes through tmux respawn-pane and never touches
// channels.sh, so none of them could shout. On 2026-08-04 that cost four hours
// of silence between 03:00 and 07:58: nothing was broken except the reporting,
// and the missing log line looked exactly like a healthy morning.
//
// WHY A BRANDED TYPE AND NOT A CALLBACK. The obvious fix is to hand
// buildMainSessionRespawnCmd a reporter function. It works, and it is what we
// first agreed -- but it leaves the failure mode this card is ABOUT still
// reachable: a new call site can pass a no-op and go quiet, and the only thing
// standing between us and that is a test that enumerates the known call sites.
// A hand-maintained list of callers is the same shape as the bug (a guard whose
// scope has to be remembered), so it was rejected deliberately.
//
// Instead, buildMainSessionRespawnCmd takes a MainConfigDecision, and the only
// way to obtain one in production is resolveMainConfigDecision(), which reports
// as it resolves. A caller cannot forget the guard, because it cannot build the
// argument without it. Forgetting becomes impossible; DELIBERATELY bypassing
// still is not -- a `as MainConfigDecision` cast or the test factory would do
// it -- but both are loud, greppable, and reviewable, which "I forgot" is not.
//
// THE RESIDUAL GAP, STATED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER: one resolve could in
// principle be reused across several respawns, which would emit one trace for
// many launches. Nothing does that today; every call site resolves inline.
